Requires the Two Factor plugin and makes emailed 2FA codes mandatory for all users by default, with per-role exclusions.

== Description ==

Requires the [Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/) plugin
(which must be installed and active) and makes its emailed 2FA codes a mandatory
baseline for every user — so the login challenge appears even for accounts that
never set up two-factor. Install network-wide or per-site on multisite.

It does two things:

1. **Forces 2FA for everyone (by default).** It ensures the always-available,
   zero-setup Email provider is enabled for every user, so the login challenge
   appears for all accounts — including those that never configured 2FA.
   Enforcement is appended rather than replacing the user's provider list, so
   users who set up a stronger factor (TOTP, hardware key / WebAuthn) keep it as
   their primary method, and backup codes remain available as a recovery path.
   Enforcement can be scoped with per-role exclusions.

2. **Restricts API logins.** XML-RPC and REST logins bypass the interactive 2FA
   screen. This plugin permits an API login to skip 2FA only when both the
   account is on an explicit allowlist and the request authenticated with an
   Application Password (never the real login password). Everyone else is denied
   on the API path.

= Plugin dependencies =

* **Required:** Two Factor (`two-factor`). Declared via the `Requires Plugins`
  header, so WordPress 6.5+ blocks activation until it is installed and active.
* **Recommended:** WebAuthn Provider for Two Factor (`two-factor-provider-webauthn`)
  for passkeys / hardware security keys. Optional — this plugin works without it.
* **Testing only:** WP Mail Logging (`wp-mail-logging`) to read 2FA email codes in
  environments with no real mail server (e.g. WordPress Playground). Not needed in
  production.

= Features =

* Mandatory email two-factor as a universal floor, with no per-user setup.
* Stronger user-configured factors (TOTP, WebAuthn) and backup codes preserved.
* Per-role exclusions, defaulting to "all users" (`FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES`).
* A `force_2fa_user_is_exempt` filter for one-off, per-user exemptions.
* Service-account allowlist for API logins, gated on Application Passwords.
* Emergency kill switch via a wp-config constant (`FORCE_2FA_DISABLE`).

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin folder at
   `wp-content/plugins/force-email-two-factor/` and activate it.
2. On multisite, choose an activation mode:
   * Network Activate to enforce across all sites (recommended baseline).
   * Activate per-site to enforce only on that site. Note: enforcement keys off
     the login entry point, not the (network-global) user, so per-site is not a
     network-wide guarantee.
3. Optional "cannot be deactivated" mode: copy the bundled `mu-loader.php` into
   `wp-content/mu-plugins/`. It force-loads the plugin on every request.

The [Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/) plugin must be
installed and active. Confirm outbound email (SMTP) delivers reliably before
rollout, since email becomes the required factor for users with no stronger one.

= Rollout checklist =

Before production activation:

* Confirm SMTP / transactional email delivery works.
* Keep a known-good administrator session open.
* Generate and safely store administrator backup codes.
* Test one non-admin login before broad rollout.
* Choose the right activation mode: single-site, Network Activate, or `mu-loader.php`.
* Identify REST/XML-RPC service accounts and decide whether they need allowlisting.
* Document the `FORCE_2FA_DISABLE` kill switch in your incident runbook.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does it require WordPress 6.5+? =

The `Requires Plugins` header that gates activation on the Two Factor plugin was
added in WordPress 6.5; on older versions that header is simply ignored. The
plugin's own runtime guard still prevents fatals if Two Factor is missing, so it
degrades safely below 6.5 — it just can't *block* activation there. If you need to
run on older WordPress, you can lower `Requires at least` and rely on that guard.

= What if email delivery breaks and users are locked out? =

Add `define( 'FORCE_2FA_DISABLE', true );` to `wp-config.php`. The plugin checks
this at load time and registers nothing while it is set. Remove the line to
re-enable enforcement.

= How do I exempt a role from forced 2FA? =

List the role slugs (lowercase keys such as `subscriber`, not display names) in
the `FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES` constant. A user is exempt only if every role they
hold is on the list, so excluding a low-privilege role can never accidentally
exempt a privileged account.

You can also override the effective list without editing this plugin:

`
add_filter( 'force_2fa_excluded_roles', function () {
	return array( 'subscriber', 'customer' );
} );
`

= How do I let an integration log in over the REST API or XML-RPC? =

Add its user ID or login to `FORCE_2FA_API_LOGIN_ALLOWLIST`, and have it
authenticate with an Application Password. A real-password API login is always
denied, even for allowlisted accounts.

You can also override the effective allowlist without editing this plugin:

`
add_filter( 'force_2fa_api_login_allowlist', function () {
	return array( 123, 'svc_headless' );
} );
`

= Should I network-activate or activate per-site on multisite? =

Network Activate for a true network-wide guarantee. Per-site activation only
enforces when the plugin is active in the site you log in through, and users are
network-global, so a user could log in via a site where it is inactive and skip
enforcement. For an un-deactivatable install, use the bundled `mu-loader.php`.

= Does this remove a user's authenticator app or hardware key? =

No. It appends the Email provider as a floor; any stronger factor the user
configured stays in place and remains their primary method.

= What are the known limitations? =

Mail delivery is part of the security boundary; if outbound email fails, users
without a stronger factor can be locked out until mail is fixed or
`FORCE_2FA_DISABLE` is enabled. This plugin only enforces the Two Factor plugin
and does not integrate with other 2FA plugins. Per-site multisite activation is
not a network-wide guarantee; use Network Activate or the optional mu-loader for
that. API bypasses are intentionally narrow: only allowlisted accounts using
Application Passwords can skip the interactive challenge.

== Changelog ==

= 1.6.1 =
* Shorten and clarify the plugin description.
* Set "Requires at least" to 6.5 to match the `Requires Plugins` dependency
  gating (the header is ignored on older WordPress) and document this in the FAQ.
* Fix stale "must-use plugin" wording in the readme.

= 1.6.0 =
* Add filter accessors `force_2fa_excluded_roles` and `force_2fa_api_login_allowlist`
  so the config constants can be overridden at runtime and injected in tests.
* Extract the filter callbacks into named functions for testability.
* Add a PHPUnit unit-test suite (zero-dependency stub bootstrap) covering the
  exclusion logic, allowlist matching, and both filter callbacks.
* Add GitHub Actions CI: lint on PHP 7.2–8.4, unit tests on PHP 8.2–8.4.

= 1.5.0 =
* Declare the Two Factor plugin as a hard dependency via the `Requires Plugins`
  header (WP 6.5+), so activation is blocked until it is present and active.
* Document dependency tiers: Two Factor (required), WebAuthn provider
  (recommended), WP Mail Logging (testing only).
* Add a WordPress Playground multisite test blueprint.

= 1.4.0 =
* Repackage as a regular plugin supporting Network Activate or per-site
  activation on multisite (was must-use only).
* Add optional `mu-loader.php` for an un-deactivatable install, with a
  `FORCE_2FA_LOADED` re-load guard so double-loading is safe.
* Document the exclusion threat model: exclusions require filesystem access and
  are an operator convenience, not an attacker-facing control; no hard floor
  protects privileged accounts.
* Verified end-to-end on a WordPress multisite (network, per-site, mu-loader,
  and kill-switch paths).

= 1.3.0 =
* Add per-role enforcement exclusions (`FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES`, default all)
  and a `force_2fa_user_is_exempt` filter for per-user overrides.

= 1.2.0 =
* API-login allowlist now requires both allowlist membership and an Application
  Password; allowlist accepts user IDs or logins.

= 1.1.0 =
* Add service-account allowlist for API logins; expand internal documentation.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release: forced email two-factor for all users, API-login guard, and
  emergency kill switch.
