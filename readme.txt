Requires the Two Factor plugin and makes emailed 2FA the default, required login factor for all users, with per-role exclusions.

== Description ==

Builds on the [Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/) plugin and
makes its emailed 2FA codes a mandatory baseline for every user — so the login
challenge appears even for accounts that never set up two-factor. Two Factor must
be active for any enforcement to happen; if it is not, this plugin activates but
stays a no-op and shows an admin notice with a one-click installer. On multisite
it is network-only: Network Activate it (per-site activation is blocked).

It does two things:

1. **Forces 2FA for everyone (by default).** It ensures the always-available,
   zero-setup Email provider is enabled for every user, so the login challenge
   appears for all accounts — including those that never configured 2FA.
   Enforcement is appended rather than replacing the user's provider list, so
   users who set up a stronger factor (TOTP, hardware key / WebAuthn) keep it as
   their primary method, and backup codes remain available as a recovery path.
   Enforcement can be scoped with per-role exclusions.

2. **Restricts API logins.** XML-RPC and REST logins bypass the interactive 2FA
   screen. This plugin permits an API login to skip 2FA only when both the
   account is on an explicit allowlist and the request authenticated with an
   Application Password (never the real login password). Everyone else is denied
   on the API path.

= Plugin dependencies =

* **Required:** Two Factor (`two-factor`). This plugin activates on its own and
  no-ops until Two Factor is active; while it is missing, an admin notice warns
  that 2FA is not being enforced and offers a one-click install/activate from
  WordPress.org. (Through 1.7.0 this was a hard `Requires Plugins` gate that
  blocked activation; 1.8.0 replaced it with this softer, guided flow.)
* **Recommended:** WebAuthn Provider for Two Factor (`two-factor-provider-webauthn`)
  for passkeys / hardware security keys. Optional — this plugin works without it.
* **Testing only:** WP Mail Logging (`wp-mail-logging`) to read 2FA email codes in
  environments with no real mail server (e.g. WordPress Playground). Not needed in
  production.

= Features =

* Mandatory email two-factor as a universal floor, with no per-user setup.
* Stronger user-configured factors (TOTP, WebAuthn) and backup codes preserved.
* Per-role exclusions, defaulting to "all users" (`FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES`).
* A `force_2fa_user_is_exempt` filter for one-off, per-user exemptions.
* Service-account allowlist for API logins, gated on Application Passwords.
* Emergency kill switch via a wp-config constant (`FORCE_2FA_DISABLE`).

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin folder at
   `wp-content/plugins/force-email-two-factor/` and activate it.
2. On multisite the plugin is network-only: **Network Activate** it (Network
   Admin → Plugins). A per-site activation is refused — an activation-hook guard
   rolls it back with a "must be Network Activated" notice, covering the admin UI
   and WP-CLI / programmatic paths. For a true network-wide guarantee, also
   **network-activate Two Factor**; the Network Admin notice warns you when it isn't.
3. Optional "cannot be deactivated" mode: WordPress only auto-loads flat PHP
   files in `wp-content/mu-plugins/` (it does not descend into subdirectories), so
   keep the full plugin folder in `wp-content/plugins/force-email-two-factor/` and
   copy ONLY the bundled `mu-loader.php` into `wp-content/mu-plugins/`. The loader
   then force-loads the plugin on every request. To disable, remove the loader
   file. A `FORCE_2FA_LOADED` guard makes it safe to also activate normally.

The [Two Factor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/) plugin must be
installed and active. Confirm outbound email (SMTP) delivers reliably before
rollout, since email becomes the required factor for users with no stronger one.

= Rollout checklist =

Before production activation:

* Confirm SMTP / transactional email delivery works.
* Keep a known-good administrator session open.
* Generate and safely store administrator backup codes.
* Test one non-admin login before broad rollout.
* Choose the right activation mode: single-site, Network Activate, or `mu-loader.php`.
* Identify REST/XML-RPC service accounts and decide whether they need allowlisting.
* If the site uses SSO/SAML/OIDC/OAuth/LDAP/Jetpack SSO, test both SSO and direct
  `wp-login.php` on staging; enforce MFA at the identity provider.
* Document the `FORCE_2FA_DISABLE` kill switch in your incident runbook.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it still require the Two Factor plugin? =

Yes — Two Factor (`two-factor`) provides the Email provider this plugin makes
mandatory, so nothing is enforced without it. As of 1.8.0 the dependency is no
longer a hard activation gate. This plugin activates on its own, no-ops while Two
Factor is inactive, and shows an admin notice with a one-click install/activate
button. The `Requires at least: 6.5` floor is now just a conservative baseline,
not a technical requirement of the (removed) `Requires Plugins` header — you can
lower it if you need to run on older WordPress.

= What if email delivery breaks and users are locked out? =

Add `define( 'FORCE_2FA_DISABLE', true );` to `wp-config.php`. The plugin checks
this at load time and registers nothing while it is set. Remove the line to
re-enable enforcement.

= What if an email code times out? =

Two Factor email codes are valid for 15 minutes by default. An expired code is
rejected like any invalid code; use **Resend Code** or restart login to generate
a fresh email code. Repeated invalid attempts are handled by the Two Factor
plugin's rate limiting and failed-attempt protections.

= How do I exempt a role from forced 2FA? =

List the role slugs (lowercase keys such as `subscriber`, not display names) in
the `FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES` constant. A user is exempt only if every role they
hold is on the list, so excluding a low-privilege role can never accidentally
exempt a privileged account.

You can also override the effective list without editing this plugin:

`
add_filter( 'force_2fa_excluded_roles', function () {
	return array( 'subscriber', 'customer' );
} );
`

= How do I let an integration log in over the REST API or XML-RPC? =

Add its user ID or login to `FORCE_2FA_API_LOGIN_ALLOWLIST`, and have it
authenticate with an Application Password. A real-password API login is always
denied, even for allowlisted accounts.

You can also override the effective allowlist without editing this plugin:

`
add_filter( 'force_2fa_api_login_allowlist', function () {
	return array( 123, 'svc_headless' );
} );
`

= Can I use this with SSO, SAML, OAuth, OIDC, LDAP, or Jetpack SSO? =

Use caution. This plugin enforces email 2FA through the Two Factor plugin's normal
WordPress login and API-login hooks; it is not an SSO MFA enforcement layer. Some
SSO plugins bypass the normal local login challenge, while others may trigger a
second local Two Factor prompt or conflict with the SSO callback.

If SSO is your primary login path, enforce MFA at the identity provider, test both
SSO and direct `wp-login.php` paths on staging, and keep a break-glass administrator
account with known-good local access and backup codes.

= How does it work on multisite? =

It is network-only: you must Network Activate it, and per-site activation is
blocked. This is deliberate — users are network-global, so a per-site install
would let someone log in via a site where the plugin is inactive and skip
enforcement. Network activation closes that gap. Note that a true network-wide
guarantee also requires the Two Factor plugin to be network-active; if it is only
site-active (or absent) somewhere, enforcement silently no-ops there, and the
Network Admin notice will tell you. For an un-deactivatable install, use the
bundled `mu-loader.php`.

= How does the plugin update, and can I turn that off? =

It updates itself from its GitHub Releases (not WordPress.org) via the bundled
Plugin Update Checker: new versions appear under **Dashboard &rarr; Updates** and
through unattended auto-updates. On sites patched by a central manager (MainWP,
Composer, git deploys), turn the self-updater off so each site does not poll
GitHub:

`
define( 'FORCE_2FA_DISABLE_SELF_UPDATE', true );
`

Your management layer then delivers updates, and enforcement is unchanged. A
**Tools &rarr; Site Health** check reports each site's update posture. See
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for the managed-vs-standalone deployment guide.

= Where do updates come from, and is the supply chain hardened? =

Updates install from GitHub Releases with no WordPress.org review gate, so the
release-publishing path is the plugin's trust boundary — a published release runs
on every site that auto-updates. The pipeline is hardened: the updater is vendored,
Actions are pinned to commit SHAs, the build is a reproducible `git archive`, only
the reviewed release asset installs, and each release carries a SHA-256 checksum you
can verify (plus a build-provenance attestation on public repositories; private
Free/Pro/Team forks are checksum-only, as attestations need GitHub Enterprise Cloud).
If you fork the plugin to serve
your own sites, point the `Update URI` header at your own repository and re-apply
the repository protections. Full guide — GitHub settings, artifact verification,
safe forking, incident response — in `docs/SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md`:
https://github.com/dknauss/Require-Email-2FA/blob/main/docs/SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md

= Does this remove a user's authenticator app or hardware key? =

No. It appends the Email provider as a floor; any stronger factor the user
configured stays in place and remains their primary method.

= What are the known limitations? =

Mail delivery is part of the security boundary; if outbound email fails, users
without a stronger factor can be locked out until mail is fixed or
`FORCE_2FA_DISABLE` is enabled. This plugin only enforces the Two Factor plugin
and does not integrate with other 2FA plugins or enforce MFA inside external SSO
providers. On multisite it is network-only (per-site activation is blocked); a true
network-wide guarantee also depends on Two Factor itself being network-active. API
bypasses are intentionally narrow: only allowlisted accounts using Application
Passwords can skip the interactive challenge.

== Changelog ==

= 1.10.1 =
* Admin UX: the dependency notice and its one-click button now reflect whether the
  Two Factor plugin is missing versus installed-but-inactive. When it is already
  installed, the button reads **Activate Two Factor** (or **Network-activate Two
  Factor** on multisite) and the copy says "installed but not active" rather than
  always offering to install it. The multisite per-site heads-up notice is likewise
  accurate about installed-but-inactive versus not installed. And when Two Factor is
  active but its Email provider has been removed (e.g. via the `two_factor_providers`
  filter), the notice says the provider must be restored instead of offering an
  Activate button that would do nothing. On multisite this restore-the-provider
  warning now also appears on the **Network Admin** plugins screen when Two Factor is
  network-active but its Email provider is unavailable — otherwise that gap (2FA
  silently not enforced network-wide) was only visible on individual site screens.
* Admin UX: after deleting Two Factor via the Plugins screen's AJAX "Delete" link,
  the dependency notice updates its copy in place — and scrolls into view — instead
  of showing stale pre-delete text, with no jarring full-page reload. This works on
  both the single-site notice and the **Network Admin** notice, and the repainted
  copy follows the screen: **Install & network-activate Two Factor** in Network
  Admin, **Install & activate Two Factor** on a single site — so the button never
  offers to activate a plugin that is no longer installed. If the current user can
  activate but not install plugins, the notice reloads (rendering the correct
  non-actionable message) rather than showing an install button they can't use.
  (The plugin's first, tiny admin script, loaded only on the Plugins screen.)

= 1.10.0 =
* Deployment: new `FORCE_2FA_DISABLE_SELF_UPDATE` constant (and
  `force_2fa_self_update_enabled` filter) to turn off the self-updater on sites
  patched by a central manager (MainWP, Composer, git deploys), so each site does
  not independently poll GitHub. One codebase, two modes; enforcement is unchanged.
  See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
* Site Health: a new **Tools &rarr; Site Health** check reports whether — and why —
  self-update is running (active, intentionally disabled, a working-copy `.git`,
  missing updater files, or a blank Update URI), instead of a page-nagging notice.
* Updater hardening: the release-asset match is anchored to exactly
  `force-email-two-factor.zip` (defense-in-depth).
* Removed the pre-1.9.0 per-site "legacy activation" migration notice. Since 1.9.0
  blocks per-site activation, no new install can reach that state, so the notice
  guarded a scenario that can no longer occur.
* i18n: use a literal `&` in the install-button labels (translators no longer see
  a raw `&amp;` entity).
* Tests & docs: added coverage for the Application-Password user binding, the
  enforcement filter's argument count, and the dependency-unmet fail-safe;
  corrected stale hook-ordering and dependency-guard descriptions.

= 1.9.1 =
* Updater: **require** the release asset. The self-updater now installs only the
  reviewed `force-email-two-factor.zip` and never falls back to GitHub's source
  archive, so a release missing that asset offers no update instead of installing
  a wrongly-structured one (`REQUIRE_RELEASE_ASSETS`).
* Security: bind the API-login Application Password check to the authenticating
  account. The bypass now requires that *this* user presented an Application
  Password this request, not merely that some app-password authentication happened.
* Enforcement: treat the dependency as met only when Two Factor actually registers
  the Email provider (checks `Two_Factor_Core::get_providers()`), not merely that
  the class exists — so a removed-Email edge case is reported instead of silently
  no-enforcing.
* Admin UX: the dependency notices show the one-click install button only when the
  current user holds every capability its handler needs; otherwise they inform
  without an action that would be denied.
* Release workflow: run the PHPCS + PHPUnit gate against the tagged commit before
  building and publishing the update asset.
* Self-updates from a git working copy are skipped (a `.git` present), so a dev
  clone is not overwritten by a release zip.

= 1.9.0 =
* Self-hosted updates: the plugin updates itself from its GitHub Releases (via the
  bundled Plugin Update Checker) rather than WordPress.org. The `Update URI` header
  is the source of truth and stops a same-named .org plugin from serving updates.
* The updater is vendored (committed) and installs a reviewed `force-email-two-factor.zip`
  release asset built by a tag-triggered workflow; workflow Actions are pinned to
  commit SHAs.
* Docs: add an FAQ explaining expired email 2FA codes.
* Multisite: the plugin is now **network-only**. A per-site activation is refused
  by an activation-hook guard (rolled back with a "must be Network Activated"
  notice, covering the admin UI and WP-CLI / programmatic paths), so enforcement
  can't be left with per-site gaps a network-global user could slip through.
  (A "Network: true" header is intentionally avoided — it would make core silently
  promote a per-site activation to network-wide instead of refusing it.)
* Add a **Network Admin notice**: when the plugin is network-active but Two Factor
  is not network-active, it warns that 2FA is not enforced network-wide and offers
  a one-click install + network-activate of Two Factor.
* Add a per-site **heads-up notice** on multisite: on any site where Two Factor is
  not loaded, site admins see that enforcement is off there and to contact the
  network admin (non-actionable — the fix lives in Network Admin).
* The one-click installer network-activates Two Factor when this plugin runs
  network-wide — including when it is loaded via the mu-loader (which now also
  triggers the Network Admin notice) — and checks `install_plugins` (to install)
  and `manage_network_plugins` (to network-activate) independently.
* Add a migration notice for installs that were activated per-site before 1.9.0:
  the activation guard only blocks NEW per-site activations, so a super admin is
  nudged to Network Activate an existing per-site install.
* Tests cover the network nag decision, the network capability rule, the per-site
  activation block, and the legacy per-site migration warning. A real multisite
  end-to-end check (`bin/multisite-e2e.sh`, run in CI) asserts that activation
  lands network-wide and the plugin safely no-ops when Two Factor is absent.

= 1.8.1 =
* Plugin header: add `Plugin URI` and `Text Domain`; set the author to Pixel
  (with `Author URI: https://wearepixel.ca`); remove the invalid `Network: false`
  header (it may only be `true`, otherwise omitted) flagged by Plugin Check.
* readme: correct the `Contributors` username to `dpknauss`.
* Add an interactive WordPress Playground "try it live" demo that lands on the
  Plugins screen with the guided Two Factor install notice and sample users.
* Tooling: enable the `WordPress.WP.I18n` sniff with a pinned text domain; bump
  pinned GitHub Actions (checkout, setup-node, upload-artifact).
* No plugin runtime or behavior changes.

= 1.8.0 =
* Replace the hard `Requires Plugins: two-factor` activation gate with a soft
  dependency: the plugin now activates on its own and no-ops until Two Factor is
  active, instead of failing activation with a "required plugins are missing"
  error.
* Add an admin notice, shown while Two Factor is inactive, warning that 2FA is
  NOT being enforced — with a one-click button that installs and activates Two
  Factor from WordPress.org (capability- and nonce-checked).
* Fold the enforcement filter's provider check into a single
  `force_2fa_dependency_met()` helper, reused by the notice.
* Tests: cover the nag gating and the required-capability logic.
* Docs: clarify the mu-plugin setup (flat loader in `mu-plugins/`, full plugin
  stays in `plugins/`) with a directory layout and how to disable it.

= 1.7.0 =
* No plugin runtime changes since 1.6.1 — this release is packaging and docs only.
* Playground: fix the demo login flow and the on-challenge 2FA-code display.
* README: rework badges (drop the static version badge; add a "Requires Two
  Factor" badge) and add a maintenance/release checklist.
* Update repository URLs after the GitHub repo was renamed to `Require-Email-2FA`
  (badges, Playground one-click link, issue-template links, Composer name).
* Correct the 1.6.1 changelog below to reflect everything that release shipped.

= 1.6.1 =
* Rename the plugin to "Require Email 2FA".
* Harden configuration handling: normalize role and allowlist values from the
  constants and filters, ignoring null, non-scalar, and empty entries without
  emitting PHP warnings.
* Add a WordPress Playground demo helper that prints the email 2FA code on the
  challenge screen (Playground/demo environments only — not for production).
* Add a production rollout checklist and expand the FAQ (runtime overrides for
  the `force_2fa_excluded_roles` / `force_2fa_api_login_allowlist` filters, and a
  known-limitations entry).
* Add a "Compatibility & interaction with other 2FA setups" section.
* Shorten and clarify the plugin description.
* Set "Requires at least" to 6.5 to match the `Requires Plugins` dependency
  gating (the header is ignored on older WordPress) and document this in the FAQ.
* Fix stale "must-use plugin" wording in the readme.
* Drop the Codecov badge/upload; keep coverage reporting in CI.

= 1.6.0 =
* Add filter accessors `force_2fa_excluded_roles` and `force_2fa_api_login_allowlist`
  so the config constants can be overridden at runtime and injected in tests.
* Extract the filter callbacks into named functions for testability.
* Add a PHPUnit unit-test suite (zero-dependency stub bootstrap) covering the
  exclusion logic, allowlist matching, and both filter callbacks.
* Add GitHub Actions CI: lint on PHP 7.2–8.4, unit tests on PHP 8.2–8.4.

= 1.5.0 =
* Declare the Two Factor plugin as a hard dependency via the `Requires Plugins`
  header (WP 6.5+), so activation is blocked until it is present and active.
* Document dependency tiers: Two Factor (required), WebAuthn provider
  (recommended), WP Mail Logging (testing only).
* Add a WordPress Playground multisite test blueprint.

= 1.4.0 =
* Repackage as a regular plugin supporting Network Activate or per-site
  activation on multisite (was must-use only).
* Add optional `mu-loader.php` for an un-deactivatable install, with a
  `FORCE_2FA_LOADED` re-load guard so double-loading is safe.
* Document the exclusion threat model: exclusions require filesystem access and
  are an operator convenience, not an attacker-facing control; no hard floor
  protects privileged accounts.
* Verified end-to-end on a WordPress multisite (network, per-site, mu-loader,
  and kill-switch paths).

= 1.3.0 =
* Add per-role enforcement exclusions (`FORCE_2FA_EXCLUDED_ROLES`, default all)
  and a `force_2fa_user_is_exempt` filter for per-user overrides.

= 1.2.0 =
* API-login allowlist now requires both allowlist membership and an Application
  Password; allowlist accepts user IDs or logins.

= 1.1.0 =
* Add service-account allowlist for API logins; expand internal documentation.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release: forced email two-factor for all users, API-login guard, and
  emergency kill switch.
