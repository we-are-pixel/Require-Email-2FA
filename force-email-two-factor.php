/**
 * Plugin Name: Require Email 2FA
 * Description:      Requires the Two Factor plugin and makes emailed 2FA the default, required login factor for all users.
 * Author:           Dan Knauss
 * Version:          1.8.0
 * Requires PHP:     7.2
 * License:          GPL-2.0-or-later
 * License URI:      https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Text Domain:      force-email-two-factor
 *
 * Soft dependency: the Two Factor plugin (slug "two-factor"). This plugin
 * activates on its own and then no-ops safely until Two Factor is active — every
 * enforcement guard below bails via force_2fa_dependency_met(). While Two Factor
 * is missing, an admin notice warns that 2FA is NOT being enforced and offers a
 * one-click install/activate from WordPress.org. (Earlier versions used the hard
 * "Requires Plugins" header, which blocked activation entirely; that was dropped
 * so first-run is a guided fix rather than a dead-end activation error.)
 * Recommended companion: "two-factor-provider-webauthn" (passkeys / hardware
 * keys) — optional; this plugin works without it. "wp-mail-logging" is only a
 * testing aid for reading 2FA codes without a real mail server.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INSTALLATION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Install the folder at wp-content/plugins/force-email-two-factor/ and activate
 * it like any plugin. On multisite you can either:
 *
 *   - Network Activate (Network Admin → Plugins) to enforce across ALL sites.
 *     This is the robust security baseline and what we recommend.
 *   - Activate per-site (a single site's Plugins screen). NOTE: on multisite,
 *     users and their Two Factor settings are network-global, while this plugin
 *     only enforces when it is active in the CURRENT request's site context.
 *     Per-site activation therefore keys enforcement off the login entry point,
 *     not off the user — a global user could authenticate via a site where this
 *     is inactive and skip enforcement. Use per-site only for "this site's team
 *     must use 2FA"; use Network Activate for a true network-wide guarantee.
 *
 * Optional "cannot be deactivated" mode: copy mu-loader.php from this folder
 * into wp-content/mu-plugins/ (a flat file). It force-loads this plugin on every
 * request so it can't be turned off from the admin. Safe to combine with normal
 * activation — a re-load guard prevents double execution.
 *
 * Requires the Two Factor plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/
 * If that plugin is inactive, every guard below no-ops safely (see notes).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EMERGENCY KILL SWITCH
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Email 2FA depends on outbound mail. If mail delivery breaks, every user who
 * has no stronger factor configured can be locked out. To disable ALL
 * enforcement in this file without deleting it, add to wp-config.php:
 *
 *     define( 'FORCE_2FA_DISABLE', true );
 *
 * Keep a known-good admin session or printed backup codes on hand the first
 * time you activate this, in case mail is misconfigured.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * a trust level that can already disable 2FA entirely. So exclusions are not an
 * attacker-facing control; they are an operator convenience. There is no hard
 * floor protecting privileged accounts: if you exclude a role that a super admin
 * or administrator holds *as their only role on a site*, that account WILL be
 * exempted on that site. Choose excluded roles deliberately. To exempt or
 * re-include a specific account surgically, prefer the force_2fa_user_is_exempt
 * filter over broad role exclusions.

 * returns true unconditionally and needs no per-user setup (it just mails a code
 * to the account address), so adding it as a floor forces the login challenge

 * recovery path. Appending instead guarantees an email floor while leaving any
 * stronger, user-chosen factor in place and primary.

/**
 * Service-account allowlist for non-interactive API logins.
 *
 * Background — what the API-login path is and how the plugin already guards it:
 * the interactive wp_login 2FA challenge does NOT cover XML-RPC or REST logins.
 * For those paths, the Two Factor plugin's default policy is to allow a login to
 * skip 2FA ONLY when the request authenticated via an Application Password (it
 * keys off did_action('application_password_did_authenticate')). A plain
 * real-password login over XML-RPC/REST is therefore already blocked for any
 * 2FA-enabled user. Our enforcement filter above makes every user 2FA-enabled,
 * so that default applies site-wide.
 *
 * What THIS allowlist adds: the plugin's default still lets ANY user log in via
 * the API as long as they present an Application Password. We tighten that to a
 * named set of service accounts — non-human integrations that cannot present an
 * emailed code, e.g.:
 *
 *   - Headless / JAMstack frontends reading content over the REST API
 *   - CI/CD or deploy pipelines hitting authenticated REST endpoints
 *   - Automation platforms (Zapier / Make / n8n / IFTTT) posting via REST
 *   - Backup, migration, or uptime-monitoring tools
 *   - The Jetpack / WordPress mobile apps (XML-RPC)
 *
 * The resulting policy is the INTERSECTION of two conditions (see filter below):
 *   (a) the account is on this allowlist, AND
 *   (b) THIS request authenticated with an Application Password.
 * So an allowlisted account that tries its real login password over the API is
 * still denied, and a non-allowlisted account is denied even with an app password.
 *
 * Each entry is EITHER a numeric user ID (int or numeric string) OR a user_login
 * (matched case-insensitively). Prefer IDs — they don't change if a login is
 * renamed.
 *
 * Hardening expectations for any account you add here:
 *   1. It authenticates with an Application Password (Users → Profile → Application
 *      Passwords), NOT the real login password. App passwords are per-integration,
 *      individually revocable, and never satisfy condition (b) when the real
 *      password is used instead.
 *   2. It has the least-privilege role the integration actually needs.
 *   3. You remove it from this list the moment the integration is retired.
 *
 * Leave the array EMPTY to deny ALL API logins (no service accounts permitted).
 *
 * @var array<int|string> User IDs and/or user_login values permitted on the API path.
