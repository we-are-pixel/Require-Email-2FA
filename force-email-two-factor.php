 * Plugin URI:       https://github.com/dknauss/Require-Email-2FA

 * Description:      Requires the Two Factor plugin and makes emailed 2FA the default, required login factor for all users.
 * Author:           Pixel
 * Author URI:       https://wearepixel.ca
 * Version:          1.9.0
 * Requires PHP:     7.2
 * License:          GPL-2.0-or-later

 *
 * Soft dependency: the Two Factor plugin (slug "two-factor"). This plugin
 * activates on its own and then no-ops safely until Two Factor is active — every
 * enforcement guard below bails via force_2fa_dependency_met(). While Two Factor
 * is missing, an admin notice warns that 2FA is NOT being enforced and offers a
 * one-click install/activate from WordPress.org. (Earlier versions used the hard
 * "Requires Plugins" header, which blocked activation entirely; that was dropped
 * so first-run is a guided fix rather than a dead-end activation error.)
 * Recommended companion: "two-factor-provider-webauthn" (passkeys / hardware
 * keys) — optional; this plugin works without it. "wp-mail-logging" is only a
 * testing aid for reading 2FA codes without a real mail server.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INSTALLATION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Install the folder at wp-content/plugins/force-email-two-factor/ and activate
 * it like any plugin. On MULTISITE it is network-only: it must be Network
 * Activated (Network Admin → Plugins) and per-site activation is refused. This is
 * deliberate — enforcement keys off whether the plugin (and Two Factor) is active
 * in the current request's site context, so a per-site install would leave gaps a
 * network-global user could slip through. force_2fa_block_single_site_activation()
 * (a register_activation_hook guard) rolls back and refuses any per-site activation
 * with a "must be Network Activated" notice, covering the admin UI and WP-CLI /
 * programmatic paths alike. (A "Network: true" header is intentionally avoided: it
 * would make core silently promote a per-site activation to network-wide rather
 * than refuse it — see force_2fa_block_single_site_activation().)
 *
 * For a true network-wide guarantee Two Factor must ALSO be network-active; if it
 * is only site-active (or absent) on some sites, enforcement silently no-ops
 * there. The Network Admin notice warns when Two Factor is not network-active.
 *
 * Optional "cannot be deactivated" mode: copy mu-loader.php from this folder
 * into wp-content/mu-plugins/ (a flat file). It force-loads this plugin on every
 * request so it can't be turned off from the admin. Safe to combine with normal
 * activation — a re-load guard prevents double execution.
 *
 * Requires the Two Factor plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/
 * If that plugin is inactive, every guard below no-ops safely (see notes).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SELF-HOSTED UPDATES (and forking)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This plugin is distributed from GitHub, not WordPress.org. The "Update URI"
 * header above is the single source of truth for updates: WordPress core (5.8+)
 * reads it and refuses to let WordPress.org serve updates for this slug (so a
 * same-named .org plugin can never hijack it), and force_2fa_bootstrap_self_update()
 * feeds it to Plugin Update Checker to pull new versions from that repo's Releases.
 *
 * TO FORK: point the "Update URI" header at your own repository. That one change
 * redirects both the updater and core's update-ownership to your fork. (Leaving it
 * on the upstream repo would auto-update every site back to upstream — do not.)
 * Everything else (slug, download asset) derives from the plugin folder name; only
 * a rename also needs the release workflow's PLUGIN_SLUG updated to match.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EMERGENCY KILL SWITCH
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Email 2FA depends on outbound mail. If mail delivery breaks, every user who
 * has no stronger factor configured can be locked out. To disable ALL
 * enforcement in this file without deleting it, add to wp-config.php:
 *
 *     define( 'FORCE_2FA_DISABLE', true );
 *
 * Keep a known-good admin session or printed backup codes on hand the first
 * time you activate this, in case mail is misconfigured.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * floor protecting privileged accounts: if you exclude a role that a super admin
 * or administrator holds *as their only role on a site*, that account WILL be
 * exempted on that site. Choose excluded roles deliberately. To exempt or
 * re-include a specific account surgically, prefer the force_2fa_user_is_exempt

/**
 * Service-account allowlist for non-interactive API logins.
 *
 * Background — what the API-login path is and how the plugin already guards it:
 * the interactive wp_login 2FA challenge does NOT cover XML-RPC or REST logins.
 * For those paths, the Two Factor plugin's default policy is to allow a login to
 * skip 2FA ONLY when the request authenticated via an Application Password (it
 * keys off did_action('application_password_did_authenticate')). A plain
 * real-password login over XML-RPC/REST is therefore already blocked for any
 * 2FA-enabled user. Our enforcement filter above makes every user 2FA-enabled,
 * so that default applies site-wide.
 *
 * What THIS allowlist adds: the plugin's default still lets ANY user log in via
 * the API as long as they present an Application Password. We tighten that to a
 * named set of service accounts — non-human integrations that cannot present an
 * emailed code, e.g.:
 *
 *   - Headless / JAMstack frontends reading content over the REST API
 *   - CI/CD or deploy pipelines hitting authenticated REST endpoints
 *   - Automation platforms (Zapier / Make / n8n / IFTTT) posting via REST
 *   - Backup, migration, or uptime-monitoring tools
 *   - The Jetpack / WordPress mobile apps (XML-RPC)
 *
 * The resulting policy is the INTERSECTION of two conditions (see filter below):
 *   (a) the account is on this allowlist, AND
 *   (b) THIS request authenticated with an Application Password.
 * So an allowlisted account that tries its real login password over the API is
 * still denied, and a non-allowlisted account is denied even with an app password.
 *
 * Each entry is EITHER a numeric user ID (int or numeric string) OR a user_login
 * (matched case-insensitively). Prefer IDs — they don't change if a login is
 * renamed.
 *
 * Hardening expectations for any account you add here:
 *   1. It authenticates with an Application Password (Users → Profile → Application
 *      Passwords), NOT the real login password. App passwords are per-integration,
 *      individually revocable, and never satisfy condition (b) when the real
 *      password is used instead.
 *   2. It has the least-privilege role the integration actually needs.
 *   3. You remove it from this list the moment the integration is retired.
 *
 * Leave the array EMPTY to deny ALL API logins (no service accounts permitted).

 * Wire self-hosted plugin updates from the GitHub repository named in Update URI.

 * WordPress core only checks WordPress.org for plugin updates; this plugin ships

 * system: it compares the installed Version header against the latest GitHub Release
 * and, when a newer one exists, offers that release's attached "<slug>.zip" through
 * the normal update flow — Dashboard → Updates, and unattended auto-updates where
 * the site has them enabled.
 *
 * Configuration is header-driven so a fork changes exactly one line (see the
 * "SELF-HOSTED UPDATES" note in the file header):
 *   - the repository comes from the Update URI header, which also stops
 *     WordPress.org from serving updates for this slug (collision protection: core
 *     honours a non-.org Update URI, and PUC additionally excludes this plugin from
 *     the wordpress.org update check by default);
 *   - the slug and the download asset name derive from the installed plugin folder,
 *     which the release workflow builds under the same name — nothing is hardcoded.
 *
 * PUC is vendored — committed under vendor/yahnis-elsts/ (a Composer dependency,
 * managed with `composer update` but tracked in git via a .gitignore exception) so
 * the exact bytes that auto-update installed sites are reviewed in-repo rather than
 * resolved from Packagist at release time. Because it is therefore also present in
 * a git checkout, the .git guard below keeps self-update from clobbering a working
 * copy; real installs (release zip, no .git) self-update normally.
 *
 * Registered on plugins_loaded rather than at file load so the zero-dependency
 * unit-test bootstrap — which records add_action() without ever firing it — never
 * instantiates PUC against WordPress functions it does not stub.
