# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Require Email 2FA. This is a small security-focused WordPress plugin, so changes should stay narrow, testable, and easy to audit.

## Development setup

Requirements:

- PHP 8.2+ for development tooling (`phpunit/phpunit` 11)
- Composer 2

Install dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

The plugin runtime supports PHP 7.2+, but the dev tools intentionally run on modern PHP. Production compatibility is enforced with `php -l` across PHP 7.2–8.4 in CI and PHPCompatibility with `testVersion 7.2-`.

## Before opening a pull request

Run:

```sh
composer check
php playground/build-blueprint.php
git diff --exit-code -- playground/blueprint.json
```

If you are validating coverage locally, use PCOV or Xdebug:

```sh
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
```

## What good changes look like

- Preserve existing users' stronger factors (TOTP, WebAuthn, backup codes).
- Keep enforcement fail-safe: if the Two Factor plugin/provider is absent, avoid fatals and avoid corrupting provider lists.
- Avoid adding UI, options, database tables, cron jobs, or remote calls unless there is a strong reason.
- Keep configuration operator-controlled through constants or filters.
- Add or update tests for security-critical behavior.
- Regenerate `playground/blueprint.json` after changing `force-email-two-factor.php`.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] I explained the behavior change and why it is needed.
- [ ] I added/updated tests where appropriate.
- [ ] `composer check` passes.
- [ ] `playground/blueprint.json` is regenerated and has no drift.
- [ ] Documentation is updated when behavior, requirements, or rollout guidance changes.
